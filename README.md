# Shopware 6 Sisow plugin

Since for some inexplicable reason Sisow offers this plugin for download [on their site](https://www.sisow.nl/developers/plug-in-implementatie/) but not on [their Github](https://github.com/Sisow?tab=repositories), I've added it here.

This serves 2 purposes;

- Now we can require it through composer easily (`composer config repositories.sisow vcs git@github.com:elgentos/shopware-sisow.git && comopser require sisow/payment`)
- Now we can do bug fixes ourselves (see [release 1.0.3](https://github.com/elgentos/shopware-sisow/commit/941fb79137972f9c44f0fdf790ed2ce3d9cb0ca7))
